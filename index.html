                    <p>
                        Hovering is important due to the main use of frones which is taking video. Being able to stabalize and stay still in an area greatly helps video.<br>
                            Steps to hovering<br>
                            1.Get drone up in air<br>
                            2.Get drone to stay in one x,y,and z axis.<br>
                    </p>
                <!--Use Cases Two-->
                <h2>

                    3.Get drone to understand -x,-y,-z axis.<br>
                    4.set up perameters for responsiveness.<br>
